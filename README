This code was created by following on from https://scriptdotsh.com/index.php/2018/09/04/malware-on-steroids-part-1-simple-cmd-reverse-shell/. I've taken some liberties and added some stuff like:

Really crappy randomness for the beacon and a timeout after X beacons to stop the thing running if something goes wrong. Also, I haven't tested that because I wasn't patient enough. 

To compile on Kali



```
apt install mingw-w64-i686-dev
apt install mingw-w64
i686-w64-mingw32-g++ rev.c -o rev.exe -lws2_32 -s -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -Wno-write-strings -fno-exceptions -fmerge-all-constants -static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc
```
Or use the makefile (you still need to install the require stuff from above.)
